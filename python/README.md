Here are some python modules I used during this project.

+ `extractLinks.py`
  - Extracting all outgoing links from each page to build an edge list.
  - Based on `BeautifulSoup` and it works fine. The only problem is speed.
+ `pagerank.py`
  - Using the edge list generated by `extractLinks.py`, calculating pagerank scores.
+ `sentiment_analysis.py`
  - Using the code from Udacity Deep Learning Foundation Course
  - Implemented sentiment analysis based on neural network
